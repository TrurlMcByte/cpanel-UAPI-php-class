##cPanel UAPI and API2 PHP class

PHP class to provide an easy to use interface with cPanelâ€™s UAPI and API2 (as of version 1.1).
The implementation is exactly the same for both, the processing done is slightly different behind the scenes.

v1.1 should be backwards compatible.

##Usage

See the example files, but typical useage takes the form of:

###Mixed mode
```
//use UAPI2 by default
$cpapi = new \cpanelAPI('user', 'password', 'cpanel.example.com');
//Set the scope to the module we want to use. in this case, DomainInfo
// and call the function we want like this.
$report[] = $cpapi->DomainInfo->list_domains();

// 'regex' not available in UAPI, so switch to API2
// Any arguments are passed into the function as an array, in the form of param => value.
$report[] = $cpapi->API2->AddonDomain->listaddondomains(array('regex' => preg_quote('www.example.com')));
print_r($report);
```
